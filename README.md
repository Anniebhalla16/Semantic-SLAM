# Semantic SLAM Pipelines (Dockerized)

This repository provides ready-to-use Docker environments for running and experimenting with state-of-the-art Semantic SLAM pipelines: **Kimera**, **Hydra**, and **Khronos**. Each pipeline is containerized for ease of setup and reproducibility, allowing researchers and developers to quickly get started with Semantic SLAM benchmarking, prototyping, and analysis.

## ðŸš€ Included Pipelines

### 1. [Kimera](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera)
- **Paper**: [Kimera: an Open-Source Library for Real-Time Metric-Semantic Localization and Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02490)
- A modular library for real-time 3D metric-semantic SLAM using visual-inertial odometry and dense semantic reconstruction.

### 2. [Hydra](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra)
- **Paper**: [Hydra: A Real-time Spatial Perception System for Semantic Robotic Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13360)
- A multi-layer spatial perception system that fuses geometry and semantics in real time for robotic exploration.

### 3. [Khronos](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Khronos)
- **Paper**: [Khronos: Geometry and Time-Aware Semantic Mapping for Long-Term Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13817)
- Introduces time as a core component in semantic mapping to enable lifelong, temporally-aware SLAM.
